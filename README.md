LSMM
===

LSMM (Latent Sparse Mixed Model), is an efficient statistical approach to integrating functional annotations with genome-wide association studies. 'LSMM' package provides model parameter estimation and statistical inference for risk SNPs and relevant annotations.

Installation
===========

To install the development version of LSMM, it's easiest to use the 'devtools' package. Note that LSMM depends on the 'Rcpp' package, which also requires appropriate setting of Rtools and Xcode for Windows and Mac OS/X, respectively.

```
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("mingjingsi/LSMM")
```

Usage
===========

[The 'LSMM' vignette](https://github.com/mingjingsi/LSMM/blob/master/inst/doc/LSMM_package.pdf?raw=true) will provide a good start point for the genetic analysis using LSMM package. The following help page will also provide quick references for LSMM package and the example command lines:

```
library(LSMM)
package?LSMM
```
